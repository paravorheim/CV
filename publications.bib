    abstract = "{Chronic ocular pain is poorly understood and difficult to manage. We developed a murine model of corneal surface injury (CSI)–induced chronic ocular neuropathic pain. The study focuses on changes in corneal nerve morphology and associated short- and long-term pain-like behavior after CSI.    CSI was induced in mice by local application of an alkali solution (0.75 N NaOH). Corneal nerve architecture, morphology, density, and length were studied. Eye-wiping was evaluated before and after CSI in response to hypertonic saline (2 M NaCl). Naltrexone (NTX) or Naloxone-methiodide (NLX-me), opioid receptor antagonists, were given subcutaneously (s.c., 3 mg/kg) or topically (eye drop, 100 μM), and then an eye-wiping test was performed.    CSI caused partial corneal deinnervation followed by gradual reinnervation. Regenerated nerves displayed increased tortuosity, beading, and branching. CSI enhanced hypertonic saline-induced eye-wiping behavior compared to baseline or sham-injury (P \\&lt; 0.01). This hypersensitivity peaked at 10 days and subsided 14 days after CSI. Administration of NTX, or NLX-me, a selective peripheral opioid antagonist, reinstated eye-wiping behavior in the injury group, but not in the sham groups (P \\&lt; 0.05).    This study introduces a model of chronic ocular pain and corneal neuropathy following CSI. CSI induces central and peripheral opioid receptor-dependent latent sensitization (LS) that is unmasked by systemic or topical administration of opioid antagonists.    This model of chronic ocular pain establishes LS as a new inhibitory mechanism in the oculotrigeminal system and may be used for potential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for ocular neuropathy.}",

	abstract = {IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) proteins play a central role in many types of cancer, and IAP antagonists are in development as anti-cancer agents. IAP antagonists cause apoptosis in many cells, but they also activate alternative NF-κB signaling through NIK, which regulates osteoclasts. In bone metastasis, a positive feedback loop between tumors and osteoclasts promotes tumor growth and osteolysis. We therefore tested the effect of IAP antagonists on the bone microenvironment for metastasis. In both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumors, growth in bone was favored compared to other sites during IAP antagonist treatment. These drugs also caused osteoporosis and increased osteoclastogenesis, mediated by NIK, and enhanced tumor-associated osteolysis. Co-treatment with zoledronic acid, a potent osteoclast inhibitor, reduced IAP antagonist-enhanced tumor growth in bone and osteolysis. Thus, IAP-based cancer treatment may be compromised by osteoporosis and enhanced skeletal metastasis which may be prevented by anti-resorptive agents.},
